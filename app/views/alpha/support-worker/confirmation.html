            <p>Your claim has been sent. We’ll contact your workplace contact to let them know that you’ve made a claim.
              They’ll need to review and approve your claim before we can process it.</p>

            <p>We’ll let you know whether they approve your claim using the contact method you chose. If your claim is approved,
              we’ll process your claim and pay the money into the bank account you chose.</p>

            <p>If your workplace contact does not approve your claim, we’ll contact you to let you know what to do next.</p>



            <p>You’ll be able to see updates about your Access to Work grant and the progress of your claim in your account.</p>
