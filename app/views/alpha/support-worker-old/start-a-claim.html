        <p>After completing your claim, it will be sent to the named contact you give us. We’ll ask them to review and confirm your claim. You’ll be notified of their decision via your chosen contact method.
          If they confirm your claim, it will be sent to Access to Work for processing.</p>
        <p>If your named contact disagrees with your claim, we’ll get in touch with what to do next.</p>
        <p>Once your claim has been processed, your payment will be sent. You’ll be able to see updates to your claim and to your Access to Work grant in your account home.</p>
